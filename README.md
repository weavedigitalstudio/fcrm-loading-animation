# FireHawk CRM Tributes - Loading Animation Add-on

There is a delay to load and populate each tribute/funeral page once they are clicked.

This plugin adds a simple css spinner animation to the grid while a tribute/funeral is loading so users know something is happening to improve usability and bounce rate.

There is a setting page to add the 'Post ID' of the page/post where your tribute grid is located.

FireHawk CRM and their WordPress tributes plugin are from [FireHawk Funerals](https://firehawkfunerals.com)
